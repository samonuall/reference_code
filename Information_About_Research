Most of this code was supplied to students in the MIT LL Beaver Works Summer Institute as part of the PiPact Independent Study Project. 
I made scan_analyze.py by myself, and messed around with pi_pact.py to encode an RPi's picked up UUID's into its broadcasted minor and major values
so that all RPi's in a network would be aware of what other RPi's were connecting to. By sharing this information between RPi's my hypothesis was that
more accurate TC4TL calculations could be made when each RPi could be aware of the connections between other RPi's in a network. 
Most of this work can be seen in the broadcast_RSSI_modes function in pi_pact.py.
